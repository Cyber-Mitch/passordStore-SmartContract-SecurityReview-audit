### [H-1] Storing the passwords on-chain makes it visible to anyone, and no longer private

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to any one, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` varible is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be called only by the owner of the contract.

We show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.


**Proof of Concept:**(Proof of Code)

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain

1. Create a locally running chain
 ```Bash
    make anvil
```
2. Deploy the contract to the chain
```
    make deploy
```
3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract.

```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can then parse that hex to a string with:

```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password. 


### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword`can be callable by anyone 

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:** 

Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test suite.

<details>
<summary>Codes</summary>

```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control modifier to the `setPassword` function. 

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

### [I-1] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a parameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect

**Description:** 

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
```

The natspec for the function `PasswordStore::getPassword` indicates it should have a parameter with the signature `getPassword(string)`. However, the actual function signature is `getPassword()`.

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line.

```diff
-     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
